My first steps in utilizing Adobe CC Photoshop and Illustrator for Web-page creation.

I love outdoors, so here is the imaginary hiking club.

The logo is made with Adobe Illustrator. The background, hawk, squirrel, bird, backpack, stone, and directional signs as a menu are all borrowed from Google images.

I also played with the HTMl <map> tag. Notice the bird jumping on menu arrows :)
